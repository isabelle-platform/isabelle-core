Isabelle is a Rust-based framework for building safe and performant servers for the variety of use cases.

## Features

 - Unified item storage with addition, editing and deletion support.
 - Collection hooks allowing plugins to do additional checks or synchronization.
 - Security checks.
 - E-Mail sending support.
 - Google Calendar integration.
 - Login/logout functionality.
 - One-time password support.

## Endpoints

1. GET /is_logged_in: check the login status.

Result:

	```
	{
	    "username": "<username>",
	    "id": <user id>,
	    "role": [ "role_is_admin" ],
	    "site_name": "Test",
	    "site_logo": "Test Logo"
	    "licensed_to": "Test Company"
	}
	```

2. POST /login (username, password inside the post request):

	```
	{
		"succeeded": true/false,
		"error": "detailed error",
	}
	```

3. POST /logout:

4. GET /itm/list (collection, [id], [id_min], [id_max], [skip], [limit], [sort_key], [filter]): read the item from the collection

	```
	{
		"map": [ <id>: {} ],
		"total_count": <value>
	}
	```

5. POST /itm/edit ("item" inside the post request and inside the query string, "collection" and "merge" = false/true in query): edit the item in collection.

	```
	{
		"succeeded": true/false,
		"error": "detailed error",
	}
	```

6. POST /itm/del (collection, id): delete the item from the collection

	```
	{
		"succeeded": true/false,
		"error": "detailed error",
	}
	```
